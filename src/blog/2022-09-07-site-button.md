Do you remember Geocities site buttons? Little 88x31 GIFs that served as links to other sites you liked. It was a good time. The internet was so much less corporate back then.

Recently I've been hanging out a lot on [cohost!](https://cohost.org/wavebeem), and I've been inspired to make my own site button by some of my new friends there.

<figure>
  <img
    src="/static/site-button.gif"
    title="wavebeem"
    alt="wavebeem"
    width="88"
    height="31"
    class="pixelated"
  />

I made a tiny [retro home page](/retro/) to showcase my button, along with other buttons I found.
