Do you remember Geocities site buttons? Little 88x31 GIFs that served as links
to other sites you liked. It was a good time. The internet was so much less
corporate back then.

Recently I've been hanging out a lot on [cohost!](https://cohost.org/wavebeem),
and I've been inspired to make my own site button by some of my new friends
there.
