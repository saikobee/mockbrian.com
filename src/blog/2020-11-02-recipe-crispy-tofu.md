## Ingredients

- 1 block of firm tofu
- Corn starch
- Oil
- Salt
- Black pepper
- Garlic powder
- Mayonnaise
- Nutritional yeast

## Preparation

Drain the tofu. Ideally you'd have a tool for this, but a pan and a towel can work in a pinch.

Preheat oven to 450 â„‰.

Cut tofu into thick slices. One block of tofu should make about 6 or 8 crispy tofu strips.

Toss the tofu in a bowl with oil, corn starch, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. You want just enough oil for the dry ingredients to stick. A little corn starch goes a long way. You don't want the tofu to be solid white. Just a very thin layer.

Bake on a sheet pan for about 30 minutes.

Remove from the oven and let cool.

Put a small amount of mayonnaise in a bowl. Toss the tofu strips to coat. A thin coating works best. Pour a generous amount of nutritional yeast on the tofu. Shake to combine. Let sit for a minute or two. Eat.

## Notes

Eat them straight up like chicken strips, or cut them before eating.

Store leftovers in the refrigerator. They reheat well in an oven or toaster oven. In fact, the mayonnaise and nutritional yeast coating becomes more cohesive with time. Sometimes these are better the next day.

If you want buffalo tofu, you can make a simple buffalo sauce by melting butter and combining with hot sauce. You can toss or dip your tofu strips in it.
