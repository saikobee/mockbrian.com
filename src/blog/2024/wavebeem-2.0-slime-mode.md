  "With cohost.org going away, I decide to lean even harder towards working on
  my personal website. I've created a new theme, with a softer, more playful
  aesthetic than ever before. I've also created many new sections on my website."

## New style: fun with pastels

**Theme inspiration: playful, pastel, slime.**

In my post about [10 years of themes](/blog/2024/10-years-of-themes/), I left
off with "summer theme". I made the summer theme as an experiment, despite it
not quite feeling like the right colors to represent _me_. It turned out that I
really liked having a warm background on the site again. It just feels so
inviting!

The missing piece was incorporating **green** into the page again. The seafoam
color was very fun, but it didn't feel like _me_.

## Dark mode: chocolate factory

**Dark theme inspiration: chocolate, matcha.**

I have difficulty reading dark themes in general, but I made one for my site
because it's clear that dark mode is an accessibility feature that countless
people enjoy.

Translating my light pastel-based theme to dark mode was quite challenging, but
I think I eventually got the hang of it!

## Fancy fonts save the day

I have been agonizing over font choice for weeks. Nothing from
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was giving the precise vibe I wanted.
I've tried again and again, but serif fonts just don't feel right on my personal
site. I love the elegance of a good serif font, but it's just wrong for me! The
most serif font content I'd consider is just for headings.

My friend [Anh](https://anhvn.com/) suggested the Pangram Pangram&reg; Foundry
[font starter pack](https://pangrampangram.com/products/fsp) to me. An amazing
52 fonts for only $29 is an absolute _steal_ of a price tag. The only "catch" is
that this is a fully non-commercial license. Good enough for me! I'm not making
money of this site, and I don't plan to.

Here's some quotes from the foundry about these font families:

### PP Agrandir

> Agrandir is a contemporary serifless type family that celebrates the beauty of
> being imperfect. It was designed to be a brave antipode to neutral modernist
> fonts ● Agrandir accepts its own shapes as they are – unaligned, quirky and
> funky. It celebrates humanity, not machines.

### PP Object Sans

> Object Sans is a contemporary type family that puts together the best
> qualities of Swiss neo-grotesks and geometric fonts ● It’s a multifunctional
> workhorse designed to work best in → any printed and on-screen contexts,
> including logo design, brand identities, websites, packaging, posters and
> headlines; regular weight is carefully tuned for small sized body text.

I couldn't agree more with their descriptions. _PP Agrandir_ is just slightly
too fancy for body text for me, but they helpfully suggested a few font pairings
on the _PP Agrandir_ page, and I've chosen _PP Object Sans_ for now.

## Improved blog post navigation

**My blog posts filtered by tags.**

You can now browse my blog posts by tags. Yay!

## Better top level organization

My main page is now more of a hub to the other sections of my site, rather than
being jam packed full of content.

There's a convenient navigation menu at the top (no JS, baby!) as well as all
navigation links being included in my fancy new footer.

Both of these locations are resilient to the "too much stuff" problem and will
hold lots of links on both mobile and desktop with ease.

## Maybe I can chill out

I'm hoping that I'll stop doing full redesigns of my site so often, haha... I
still haven't made any [shrines](/shrines/) yet, but I'm planning to unleash my
creativity there.

## More blog posts coming soon

I have 3 more blog posts currently in draft status. Look forward to those soon
(names tentative).

- _10 years of React_

- _CSS obfuscation and usertyles_

- _Are JavaScript expression statements dangerous?_
