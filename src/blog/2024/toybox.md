Introducing: [The Toybox](/toybox/). I make no promsises about what will live
there and for how long. It's not a blog, it's a toybox. It's there for me to
have fun. I imported a few "CSS crimes" from cohost.org to the toybox, as well
as my [flashlight blog post](/blog/2024/flashlight-making-toys-for-the-web/).
These will also show up in my RSS feed, though you'll need to visit my website
for them to work correctly.
