  The web is an app platform

  The web is not merely a document platform. It has been an app platform for nearly its entirely life. I discuss the history of the web and my thoughts about why the web as an app platform has been incredible.

## A web timeline

This section covers a timeline of the web and key technologies related to it.

### 1990 - Birth

The first web browser was created: [WorldWideWeb](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/browser-history/). It was created in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee while he was working for CERN.

### 1994 - Netscape Navigator

[Netscape Navigator](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/browser-history/) was released in 1994. It was the first widely popular web browser.

### 1995 - HTML 2.0

The HTML 2.0 specification was published as [RFC 1866](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1866) in November 1995. It included the initial version of HTML forms: text inputs (regular, password, and multi-line), checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, submit buttons, reset buttons, hidden fields, and the reset button. This includes both GET and POST form submission types, explicitly allowing for side-effects from an HTML form.

### 1997 - ECMAScript

[ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#The_rise_of_JScript) was published in June 1997. Microsoft had already reverse engineered Netscape Navigator's JavaScript language, but this marked the beginning of JS as an open standard for the web.

### 2009 - ECMAScript 5

[ECMAScript 5](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/) was published in 2009. JS became a lot more powerful with this release.

### 2012 - NW.js (aka node-webkit)

[Version 0.2.0 of NW.js](https://github.com/nwjs/nw.js/releases/tag/v0.2.0) was released in 2012. This framework later inspired Electron and helped start the trend of shipping web applications as native applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### 2015 - ECMAScript 2015 (aka ES6)

[ECMAScript 2015](https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/) was published in 2015. This marked the shift towards publishing yearly ECMAScript revisions and a shift towards continuously updated (evergreen) web browsers.

## Misc


The web doesn't care how you classify what it is or should be

Complaining online about bad websites feels good, but it doesn't accomplish much good

The attitude of "fuck computers" and "web development is awful" and similar statements are brain poison: they hurt you just by thinking about them

Remember image maps? Combine image maps with a little bit of server-side state and it's pretty easy to make a game that doesn't require any real-time reaction
