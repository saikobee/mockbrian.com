I'm Brian Mock (he/him). I live in Portland, Oregon, where I make software,
keyboards, and pixel art. When I'm not at my computer, you can find me playing
with my cat or running.

- I organize Portland's monthly mechanical keyboard meetup,
  [PDXKBC](https://pdxkbc.com).

- I'm the maintainer of a great parsing library for JavaScript called
  [Parsimmon](https://github.com/jneen/parsimmon).

- I created [pkmn.help](https://pkmn.help), a Pok√©mon website with thousands of
  monthly users.

- I also made a tool called [jsx-info](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsx-info)
  that analyzes your JSX usage.
