## Saying goodbye to "Slime Mode"

The idea behind "Slime Mode" was to lean in to warm colors I introduced in my
life (I use "Night Mode" 24/7 for warm tinting). Eventually I grew tired of the
warm background, though. It really gave that _sun baked_ feeling I was going
for, but part of the problem was how I couldn't seem to pair it with a green I
liked. Green has been an important color in
[nearly every theme I've made](/blog/2024/10-years-of-themes/).

## No love for edgy "Cyber Mode"

**Cyber Mode**

- **Cold:** Green is flanked with gray and grayer
- **Sharp:** Strange shapes on the cards and the oddly satisfying font
  ([PP Model Sans](https://pangrampangram.com/products/model-sans))
- **Bold:** The green at the top really pops, given the almost complete lack of
  any other colors

**Synthesis: Balanced, round, bold**

- **Balanced:** Warm, cool, and neutral elements
- **Round:** Mostly round, but the scalloped top gives just a hint of sharpness
- **Bold:** Bold colors, including my favorite green, without sucking the life
  out of everything else

## The inspiration

I'll admit that I was inspired by...
