## What to expect

I've never done a video games roundup post before. I'm going to present a list
of all the games I remember playing this year (with brief notes), and then
sections about each game I want to discuss more afterward.

## The list

  - 2024 -- _Path of Exile 2_

  - 2024 -- _Helldivers 2_

- **Shelved**

  - 2024 -- _Dokimon: Quest_

    This game has some nice quality of life features I wish Pok√©mon had, but
    otherwise it's just not super fun to me.

  - 2018 -- _Judgment_

    I was really digging the story in this for a while, but the actual gameplay
    got stale to me. I think I'm done with _Ryu ga Gotoku Studios_ games for...
    a while. I really didn't like the sidequest writing. The voice acting was
    great. I looked up every cutscene for the end of the game, and I think the
    twists maybe got a bit out of hand.

  - 2013 -- _Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster_

    I simply could not have fun playing this game. Supposedly it gets more
    interested shortly after I stopped playing, but I couldn't summon the
    willpower to keep going. I can tell there's some cool fucky story stuff
    going on with the multiple worlds, but I'm just keeping this on the shelf.
    I'd rather just hear a friend explain it to me some time.

  - 2024 -- _RKGK_

    I just didn't have fun playing this. I only logged a few hours.

  - 2022 -- _Chico and the Magic Orchards_

    Incredibly cute, but I didn't really like the mental math of the positioning
    and angles necessary to beat the puzzles.

  - 2024 -- _Isles of Sea and Sky_

    I heard "Zelda without combat" but what I actually got was "open world
    sokoban". I found it incredibly overwhelming the way the game was massively
    interconnected, making it unclear which rooms I should even spend my time
    in.

  - 2023 -- _Star Ocean: The Second Story R_

    Killer music. Subpar English voice acting. Cliche story. Combat felt like a
    bad version of _Tales of Symphonia_. I stopped playing after the difficulty
    spiked in the mid-late game, leading to me being frustrated.

  - 2014 -- _Momodora III_

    I liked _Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight_, _Momodora: Moonlit
    Farewell_, and even _Momodora II_, but I didn't really like _Momodora III_.
    It's super cute, but the levels felt a bit mean (lots of one hit kill
    surprises), and the tiny sprites + fast button mashing attacks + tough
    bosses was a frustrating combination to me.

  - 2010 -- _Alpha Protocol_

    Well, I actually beat this game a few times before. I decided to stream it
    for another playthrough this year, but I gave up without finishing it,
    mostly because my stream attendance was really low. It's a worse game than I
    remember, but I still think it did some interesting stuff. I'd love to see a
    reboot of this franchise.
