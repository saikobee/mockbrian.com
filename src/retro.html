<h1>retro page</h1>

<p>
  this page was created as a fun little geocities-esque 1990s internet
  throwback.
</p>

<p>
  ok, i really just wanted a place to put my lovingly crafted site button, but
  couldn't figure out how to fit it into my main page layout.
</p>

<h2>site buttons</h2>

<div class="button-grid">
  <img
    src="/static/site-button.gif"
    title="wavebeem"
    alt="wavebeem"
    width="88"
    height="31"
    class="site-button"
  />
  {% for img in siteButtons %}
  <img
    src="{{ img.url }}"
    title="{{ img.name }}"
    alt="{{ img.name }}"
    width="88"
    height="31"
    class="site-button"
  />
  {% endfor %}
</div>

<h2>credit</h2>

<p>
  all other site buttons are from
  <a href="https://88by31.neocities.org/" class="bit-link">88by31</a> on
  neocities. credit for each button can be found there.
