  <h2>Sage Fennel</h2>

  <p>
    My name is <i>Sage Fennel</i>. Please note that <i>Fennel</i> is actually my
    middle name. I haven't decided on a last name yet. You may enter
    <i>Fennel</i> as my last name in contexts that require two names but do not
    need my legal name.
  </p>

  <h2>Pronouns</h2>

  <p>My pronouns are <i>they/them/theirs.</i></p>

  <h2>wavebeem</h2>

  <p>
    I'm known universally as <i>wavebeem</i> online. You may call me
    <i>wavebeem</i> on the internet, or <i>wave</i> in in-game voice chat if you
    forget my real name. Please do not capitalize <i>wavebeem</i>.
  </p>

  <h2>Legal name</h2>

  <p>
    My legal name is currently <i>Brian Mock</i>. You may only use this name
    when legally required to, or when explaining my new name to someone who only
    knows me by my previous name.
  </p>

  <h2>Other terms</h2>

  <p>
    I do not use honorifics such as Mr, Ms, or Mx. I prefer gender neutral terms
    when possible. Otherwise be creative, or use a feminine term. For example, I
    would prefer <q>Queen Sage</q> to <q>King Sage</q>, but
    <q>Your Highness</q>, <q>The Royal Sage</q>, and <q>monarch</q> are better.
