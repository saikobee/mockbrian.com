<h2 class="sage-bright">Sage Fennel</h2>

<p>
  My name is <i class="sage-bright">Sage Fennel</i>. Please note that
  <i class="sage-bright">Fennel</i> is actually my middle name. I haven't
  decided on a last name yet. You may enter
  <i class="sage-bright">Fennel</i> as my last name in contexts that require
  two names but do not need my legal name.
</p>

<h2 class="sage-bright">Pronouns</h2>

<p>My pronouns are <i class="sage-bright">they/them/theirs.</i></p>

<h2 class="sage-bright">wavebeem</h2>

<p>
  I'm known universally as <i class="sage-bright">wavebeem</i> online. You may
  call me <i class="sage-bright">wavebeem</i> on the internet, or
  <i class="sage-bright">wave</i> in in-game voice chat if you forget my real
  name. Please do not capitalize <i class="sage-bright">wavebeem</i>.
</p>

<h2 class="sage-bright">Legal name</h2>

<p>
  My legal name is currently <i class="sage-bright">Brian Mock</i>. You may
  only use this name when legally required to, or when explaining my new name to
  someone who only knows me by my previous name.
</p>

<h2 class="sage-bright">Other terms</h2>

<p>
  I do not use honorifics such as Mr, Ms, or Mx. I prefer gender neutral terms
  when possible. Otherwise be creative, or use a feminine term. For example, I
  would prefer <q>Queen Sage</q> to <q>King Sage</q>, but <q>Your Highness</q>,
  <q>The Royal Sage</q>, and <q>monarch</q> are better.
</p>
