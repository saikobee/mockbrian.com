  <h2 class="candy-bright">Sage Fennel</h2>

  <p>
    My name is <i class="candy-bright">Sage Fennel</i>. Please note that
    <i class="candy-bright">Fennel</i> is actually my middle name. I haven't
    decided on a last name yet. You may enter
    <i class="candy-bright">Fennel</i> as my last name in contexts that require
    two names but do not need my legal name.
  </p>

  <h2 class="candy-bright">Pronouns</h2>

  <p>My pronouns are <i class="candy-bright">they/them/theirs.</i></p>

  <h2 class="candy-bright">wavebeem</h2>

  <p>
    I'm known universally as <i class="candy-bright">wavebeem</i> online. You
    may call me <i class="candy-bright">wavebeem</i> on the internet, or
    <i class="candy-bright">wave</i> in in-game voice chat if you forget my real
    name. Please do not capitalize <i class="candy-bright">wavebeem</i>.
  </p>

  <h2 class="candy-bright">Legal name</h2>

  <p>
    My legal name is currently <i class="candy-bright">Brian Mock</i>. You may
    only use this name when legally required to, or when explaining my new name
    to someone who only knows me by my previous name.
  </p>

  <h2 class="candy-bright">Other terms</h2>

  <p>
    I do not use honorifics such as Mr, Ms, or Mx. I prefer gender neutral terms
    when possible. Otherwise be creative, or use a feminine term. For example, I
    would prefer <q>Queen Sage</q> to <q>King Sage</q>, but
    <q>Your Highness</q>, <q>The Royal Sage</q>, and <q>monarch</q> are better.
